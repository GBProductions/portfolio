            <p>Bio: I'm Garrett (they/them). After graduating with a degree in Anthropology from Pacific University in 2017, I worked in Portland theatre tech up until the COVID-19 Pandemic. </p>
            <p>I decided to take an opportunity to learn programming in order to secure a steady future. I also want to incorporate more technology into art and theatre.</p>
